# SwagCraft-SG
This project aims at recreating the "Survival Games" minigame from the "SwagCraft" server utilising the Minestom API.

It is heavily WIP and is not recommended for use in a production environment. However, it is open to contributions and suggestions.

## Features
- Kit Selection (Partial)
- Map Rotation (Partial)
